# Pin-Manager-Discord-Bot-
This bot checks the number of pinned messages in a channel, and if they have reached the limit the channel is locked and archived. A new channel will be created to replace the old one.
> This was made for a small server of friends where we pin funny messages to save them.

> note: I was unaware that the token can be found in the production folder, uploading this made me have to reset the bot's token and restart it.
